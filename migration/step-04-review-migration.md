## Understanding Common Migration Patterns

Here's what you might see based on different approaches:

### Pattern 1: Azure Functions + App Service

**Files You'll See:**
```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api/                          # API project
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Program.cs               # Modern .NET minimal API or
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Startup.cs               # .NET Core Web API
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ appsettings.json         # Configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scheduler/                    # Scheduled task
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TimerFunction.cs         # Azure Function
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ host.json                # Function host config
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ local.settings.json      # Local settings
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ infra/                       # Infrastructure (optional)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.bicep              # Bicep template
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                    # Documentation
```

**Scheduled Task**: Azure Function with Timer Trigger
```csharp
[FunctionName("ScheduledGreeting")]
public async Task Run([TimerTrigger("0 */1 * * * *")] TimerInfo timer)
{
    // Calls API every minute
}
```

### Pattern 2: Azure Container Apps

**Files You'll See:**
```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Api/                     # API project
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Scheduler/               # Scheduled task
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile                   # For API
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile.scheduler         # For scheduler
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-compose.yml           # Local testing
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ deployment/                  # K8s or ACA manifests
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
```

**Scheduled Task**: Cron job in Container Apps or Kubernetes

### Pattern 3: All Azure Functions

**Files You'll See:**
```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Functions/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ HttpMessageFunction.cs   # API endpoint
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TimerGreetingFunction.cs # Scheduled task
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ host.json
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ local.settings.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
```

## Reviewing Code Changes

### API Code Review Checklist

- [ ] **Endpoints**: Verify the API endpoint paths
  - Original: `GET /api/message`
  - Migrated: Should be the same or clearly documented

- [ ] **Response Format**: Check if response structure is preserved
  ```json
  {
    "message": "timestamp - Hello World",
    "timestamp": "ISO-8601 datetime"
  }
  ```

- [ ] **Dependencies**: Review NuGet packages or dependencies
  - Modern .NET packages
  - Azure SDK packages
  - No unnecessary dependencies

- [ ] **Error Handling**: Ensure proper error handling exists

### Scheduled Task Code Review Checklist

- [ ] **Schedule Configuration**: Verify timer/cron expression
  - Should trigger every minute
  - Format: `"0 */1 * * * *"` for Azure Functions
  - Or appropriate format for the chosen service

- [ ] **API Call**: Check how it calls the API
  - Uses HTTP client
  - Correct endpoint URL
  - Handles responses properly

- [ ] **Error Handling**: Retry logic and error handling

---

## Configuration Review

### Check Configuration Files

- [ ] **Application Settings**
  - API URL for the scheduled task
  - Any feature flags
  - Logging configuration

- [ ] **Local Development Settings**
  - Local emulator settings (if using Azure Functions)
  - Local API URL
  - Debug settings

- [ ] **Azure Settings**
  - Resource names
  - Connection strings
  - Feature settings

### Security Review

- [ ] Secrets are not hardcoded
- [ ] Sensitive data uses environment variables
- [ ] Configuration templates are provided (not actual secrets)
- [ ] Azure Key Vault mentioned (if applicable)
