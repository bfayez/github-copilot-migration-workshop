# Step 1: Create Assessment Issue for Modernization

## Objective
In this step, you'll create a GitHub issue and assign it to GitHub Copilot to assess the current application and recommend the best modernization approach for migrating to Azure.

### Step Progress Checklist
- [ ] Review the current application structure
- [ ] Create a new GitHub issue
- [ ] Write the assessment prompt
- [ ] Assign the issue to GitHub Copilot (@copilot)
- [ ] Wait for Copilot to complete the assessment
- [ ] Verify Copilot has responded with recommendations

---

## Understanding the Current Application

Before creating the issue, let's recap what Copilot needs to know:

### Key Information
- **Application Type**: .NET Framework 4.8.1 (Windows-only)
- **Components**: 
  - REST API (MessageService)
  - Console Application (GreetingsConsole)
- **Critical Requirement**: Console app is **scheduled to run every minute**
- **Target Platform**: Azure Cloud

---

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Navigate to GitHub Issues

- [ ] Go to your repository on GitHub
- [ ] Click on the "Issues" tab
- [ ] Click the green "New issue" button

### 2. Create the Assessment Issue

Use the following details for your issue:

#### Issue Title
```
Assess and recommend best approach for modernizing application to Azure
```

#### Issue Description (Copy this prompt)

```markdown
@copilot I need your help to modernize our current .NET Framework 4.8.1 application and migrate it to Azure.

## Current Application Overview

Our application consists of two components:

1. **MessageService** - A REST API built with ASP.NET Web API 2
   - Provides a `/api/message` endpoint
   - Returns timestamped greeting messages
   - Currently runs on IIS/IIS Express

2. **GreetingsConsole** - A console application that:
   - Calls the MessageService API
   - Displays the greeting messages
   - **Important**: This console app is scheduled to run every minute

## Requirements

Please analyze the current application and provide:

1. **Best Recommendation**: What is the optimal approach for modernizing this application for Azure?

2. **Architecture Proposal**: How should we restructure the components for cloud-native operation?

3. **Alternative Options**: What other viable approaches exist?

4. **Comparison Table**: Provide a comparison of options with:
   - Advantages of each approach
   - Disadvantages of each approach
   - Estimated complexity
   - Cost implications
   - Best use cases

5. **Migration Considerations**: What should we be aware of during migration?
   - The console app runs every minute (scheduled task)
   - Need for scalability
   - Cost optimization
   - Operational simplicity

## Expected Deliverables

Please provide:
- Clear recommendation with justification
- Architecture diagrams or descriptions
- Detailed comparison of options
- Migration path overview

Take your time to provide a thorough analysis. Thank you! üöÄ
```

### 3. Assign to GitHub Copilot

- [ ] On the right sidebar, find "Assignees"
- [ ] Type `@copilot` or `copilot`
- [ ] Select GitHub Copilot from the dropdown
- [ ] Verify Copilot is assigned to the issue

### 4. Add Labels (Optional but Recommended)

Consider adding labels like:
- [ ] `modernization`
- [ ] `assessment`
- [ ] `azure`
- [ ] `copilot-task`

### 5. Submit the Issue

- [ ] Review your issue content
- [ ] Click "Submit new issue"
- [ ] Note the issue number for reference

---

## What Happens Next?

Once you submit the issue:

1. **Copilot Analyzes**: GitHub Copilot will analyze your repository and the requirements
2. **Copilot Plans**: It will create a plan for the assessment
3. **Copilot Responds**: It will comment on the issue with detailed recommendations
4. **Time Required**: This typically takes a few minutes

### You'll Know Copilot is Done When:
- [ ] You receive a notification from GitHub
- [ ] The issue has new comments from @copilot
- [ ] You see a detailed analysis and recommendations

---

## Tips for Success

‚úÖ **Do's:**
- Be specific about the scheduled task requirement (runs every minute)
- Clearly state the target platform (Azure)
- Ask for comparisons and trade-offs
- Request both recommended and alternative approaches

‚ùå **Don'ts:**
- Don't assign multiple issues to Copilot simultaneously (wait for each to complete)
- Don't modify the issue description while Copilot is working
- Don't close the issue before Copilot responds

---

## Troubleshooting

### Copilot Doesn't Respond
- Wait a few minutes; analysis takes time
- Verify Copilot is properly assigned
- Check if Copilot is enabled for your repository
- Ensure you have the necessary permissions

### Issue Assignment Not Working
- Ensure GitHub Copilot is available for your account
- Try typing `@copilot` with the @ symbol
- Verify repository settings allow Copilot access
