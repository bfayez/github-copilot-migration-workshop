# GitHub Copilot Migration Workshop

Welcome to the GitHub Copilot Migration Workshop! This workshop demonstrates how to use GitHub Copilot not just as a coding assistant, but as an autonomous team member that can handle complete application modernization tasks.

## üéØ Workshop Overview

Learn to leverage GitHub Copilot to modernize a legacy .NET Framework application and migrate it to Azure cloud services. You'll experience firsthand how Copilot can analyze, plan, implement, and document complex migration projects.

### What You'll Learn

- üìù How to use GitHub Copilot as a pair programmer in VS Code
- ü§ñ How to assign tasks to GitHub Copilot as a team member
- üîÑ Application modernization strategies and best practices
- ‚òÅÔ∏è Migrating legacy applications to Azure
- üß™ Testing cloud applications locally with GitHub Codespaces
- üöÄ Deploying to Azure with manual or automated CI/CD approaches

### Workshop Outcomes

By completing this workshop, you will:

1. ‚úÖ Understand the two modes of using GitHub Copilot
2. ‚úÖ Have a modernization assessment with multiple options and trade-offs
3. ‚úÖ Successfully migrate a .NET Framework app to modern cloud-native architecture
4. ‚úÖ Deploy a working application to Azure
5. ‚úÖ (Optional) Set up automated CI/CD pipelines

## üìã Prerequisites

Before starting the workshop:

- [ ] GitHub account with Copilot access enabled
- [ ] Access to this repository (fork or clone)
- [ ] Basic understanding of .NET applications
- [ ] Azure subscription (free tier works fine)
- [ ] GitHub Codespaces available OR local development environment

## üèóÔ∏è Current Application Architecture

The workshop starts with a legacy application consisting of:

### Components

1. **MessageService** - REST API (ASP.NET Web API 2, .NET Framework 4.8.1)
   - Endpoint: `GET /api/message`
   - Returns timestamped greeting messages
   - Runs on IIS/IIS Express

2. **GreetingsConsole** - Console Application (.NET Framework 4.8.1)
   - Calls the MessageService API
   - Displays greeting messages
   - **Scheduled to run every minute** (important for migration)

### Current Limitations

- Windows-only (.NET Framework 4.8.1)
- Requires IIS for hosting
- Not cloud-native
- Manual scaling
- Legacy deployment model
